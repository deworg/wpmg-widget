List of all German-speaking WordPress meetups as a widget.

## Description ##

The WordPress community in Germany, Austria and Switzerland has changed and grown a lot in the past few years.
To maintain a current list of all active meetups can be a lot of work for every individual meetup and takes a lot of time.
With the data from [wpmeetups.de](https://wpmeetups.de/meetup/), this plugin enables any WordPress meetup to include a small
widget into their sites, with a current list of all active meetup in the German-speaking community.
